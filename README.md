Powered by **Ethereum** and **Artificial Intelligence**, we strive to build a platform that allows NGOs to accept donations in a transparent fashion and also allow their **promoters** ( these can be social media personalities, small businesses, etc.) to raise funds for the NGOs of their choice freely without having to worry about tainting their reputation or having to manage the collected money themselves.

## **Research**

### Blast from the past

Did you know that data analytics has played a crucial role in the fight against theÂ [Ebola virus](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/01/how-big-data-could-help-stop-the-ebola-outbreakcommentary.html#.)? Data science has allowed NGOs and humanitarian activists to curtail the spread of the virus, anticipate outbreaks, and much more. Beyond preventing the spread of a deadly virus, NGOs have to tackle many challenges. But it's expensive for these small NGO's

Some of the challenges of a non-profit include, but are not limited to, coordinating activities in a crisis, fundraising, as well as managing their funds to make the most out of their money. However, with the rise of data analytics or data science, it is now possible for NGOs to work better and operate faster than ever before.

### Here are four ways data science benefits NGOs

- Budgeting
- Social Media Management
- Fundraising
- Monitoring activities

# **Implementation**

## **Organization**

### For the NGOs

Most small NGOs without a dedicated modern bookkeeping/accountant take donations through paper-based slip books or personal UPI of NGO members. We trust that we can do better in this space. We can essentially provide **Analytics and Accounting as a Service** to these NGOs who otherwise can't afford to have dedicated employees for this.

**How Artificial Intelligence can help these NGOs:**

- Using Deep Learning , we can analyse the historic trends of donations generated by several sources and **predict** how much cash flow can the organisation expect in future months so that rainy days can be anticipated in advance.
- By analysing news and other sources,  the platform can also **suggest resource allocation** to different causes for the NGO. For Example, by analysing the distress news coming from different news portals regarding vaccines, bed availability, oxygen cylinder supply, it can help organisations better decide which issue they should focus more on and allocate more funds to. This will allow organisations to base their decisions on real data and well informed analysis rather than relying on guesswork and chance.
- We can also plan to utilise incoming news reports and statistics to identify high priority regions compared to lower priority regions.
- ... and much more. AI can bring the power of accountancy and foresight in the hands of small organizations that were previously restricted to only big NGOs like WHO and United Nations who **can afford to pay salaries** to top data scientists and accountants while smaller bodies struggle to keep the lights on and keep a roof over their head.

## **Influencers**

Many times, social media personalities and Influencers have to accept donations in their personal bank accounts to keep track of how much funds their live streams / Instagram promotions raised for any charitable cause. But there's always a valid doubt in people's minds that if the money actually got donated to the organisation instead of being siphoned off elsewhere. Using our solution, the influencers can have a valid proof of their and their fanbase's contributions without having to accept the money in their personal accounts.

## **NFT's**

Unique  cascading NFT's to our top Donors

### Appreciation through NFT based Incentives

We got this idea while we were exploring the Rarible Protocol. We also aim to provide NGOs the ability to gift NFTs to top fundraisers in the community as a token of their gratitude for helping these organizations save countless valuable lives. This will be a very nice reward for the influencer's efforts as not only do they get a unique piece of cybernetic art to cherish, but it also has a financial value attached to it.
